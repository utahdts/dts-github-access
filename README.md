# dts-github-access
This repository explains how to gain access to the `utahdts` GitHub organization.
This information is taken from the [GitHub License Tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX1OA8Wwv4ISU7hmGWxjin94r76eyC8clWHUEz361iQ/edit?usp=sharing).
This spreadsheet has restrictions so it may not be visible, but its "Process" tab has been copied here for exposure.

To request a new license:
1. [Fill out this form](https://forms.gle/jwtVia6mHLZWVrVh8)
	1. **"GitHub Organization needing assigned to"** is "DTS (support multiple agencies)"
	1. **"Needs Visual Studio License Purchased w/GitHub?"** probably a "no", but if you do need one you can check "yes"
	1. **"Type of request"** is "Assign new user/license" unless you know someone to remove and you are taking their license.
